I have it encased in tuppaware and it sits on the roof of my van. I'm able to pickup wifi signals on all the bands ( b, n, g) and it has a pretty good range.I've come to learn how important 'line of site' is. If you have a building between you and a hotspot you're probably not going to even see it. If you do have line of site you'll probably be able to see hotspots up to a block or two away!The ultimate antenna is a parabolic dish aka grid antenna, but that is very directional, so it was not a good option for me since my van is always mobile. This omni directional antenna was the best choice because I don't have to constanly aim it every where I go. If you live in an urban environment where line of site is not great then you'll probably be better off with this omni directional antenna as well.If you get this antenna make sure you use the wifi software that comes with it because you will see more hotspots. Your standard windows wifi program will definitely show you a lot more than it did before, but I noticed if you have more than one hotspot using the same name then the Windows wifi software will only show one. For an example, I was out in my van an could chose wifi from either Mcdonalds or Starbucks, but since they both had the same name \"AT&T;\" only one showed up in the Windows wifi utility, but BOTH showed up in the wifi software that comes with this anntena. So definitely use the software that comes with it. It even works better than any of the other wifi softwares that you can find on the Internet. Those other programs don't allow you to connect to a network directly through the program, they make you connect using the Window's wifi utility and as I just explained, the Windows utility doesn't show multiple hotspots if they have the same name.Anyway, it works well. Just make sure you have decent line of site or no antenna will work especially if there is a steel or concrete building in your path.

I never know what hotel room I'll be in, or how close to the WiFi hotspots I'll be.  For weeks I've used my laptop's built-in Centrino adapter (I bought a Lenovo Ideapad Y500 in Feb '13, so not old by any means).The difference with this device is astounding.  Not only do signals appear stronger, but importantly, this device allows for significantly greater throughput as compared to the built-in adapter when connected to the exact same network.  I ran some speed tests using speedtest.net.  With the internal adapter, download speeds were hovering around 6Mbps, upload speeds around 2Mpbs.  With the Etekcity adapter connected to the same network, speeds jumped to 29Mbps download and 9Mbps upload.  Multiple tests of both adapters proved this wasn't one-time flukes.Simply astounding.I was concerned about whether this product would actually make any noticeable difference.  Without question, it is a fantastic little device.  My only gripe is that it is not particularly friendly to pack away in a bag quickly.

It does not have wireless capability and I want to make it so, as I may soon move somewhere that I'm using someone else's router/modem, and it's a long way from the hub.  I tried a PCI wireless card first, but I use my computer for audio recording, and the sound was noticeably worse, presumably from having a transmitter right next to the sound card.  This solution will keep RF well away from your precious recordings.This review is prior to moving, so I can't say about distance capability, but judging from the 2 antennae, it should be as good or better than anything out there.  It only runs 2.4GHz and 802.11n, not 5GHz or 802.11ac or anything like that.  Anyway the Cisco E4200 router I have runs about 55-60 Mbps download and 6-8 Mbps upload according to Cisco's own software, over standard Charter cable.  Installed this in seconds, the software that comes with it on a 3\" CD-ROM is current (12/2012), I ran that, this transmitter worked like a charm, at the same speed as the Cisco hub itself.  Also installed it on a little Asus netbook, with the same results.  I can also see more signals from neighbors than I've ever seen before, so it's obviously very sensitive.This should be perfect for someone who wants to make something that's not wireless, wireless, and REALLY good for travel when you're in a hotel room or anywhere with a weak signal.  It's small, easy to carry, and sets up in seconds.  I just advise you install the software from the CD-ROM in your laptop first (not the internet, the RA-LINK software there isn't as comprehensive), so you'll be ready for anything that's thrown at you.So it's not ultra-fast or the latest greatest, but it works and works well.

The Etekcity wlan USB adapter works very nicely with my computers (openSUSE 13.1 and Fedora 19).  I have not tried this wlan adapter in Windows at all so I can't comment on how good it is or isn't within that operating system.  Also, I have not tested if the wlan adapter can really transfer data over a wireless network @ 300 Mbps within a 802.11n network as I've only connected it to 802.11g networks.  But, with openSUSE and Fedora, this wlan adapter works very good.  No issues with drivers/firmware.  Just plug in and both openSUSE and Fedora detect the wlan adapter.  Simple to use cli and  gui tools to connect to both open/unprotected wlan and WPA2 protected wlan with SSID broadcasting disabled as well as enabled (especially since don't have to deal with firmware related issues as it works right out of the box).  In addition, the real power of this wlan adapters (as well as many of the Alfa ones) is that it is easy to set this adapter to monitor mode, scan for other wireless networks, packet injection, etc (as long as the user is capable ;)  This makes the Etekcity wlan adapter pretty good for completing a site survey to make sure setups of a new wlan network have the appropriate settings for where it is being deployed to verifying the security of your own wlan networks.  On top of all this, the wlan adapter can operate on 802.11 b/n/g networks and is amplified allowing for longer wireless range.  Lastly, the price of this wlan adapter (at least when I bought it) was pretty much 1/2 of a comparable Alfa wlan adapter with nearly the same features.
